To run as a Windows service (example: sc create IPBAN type= own start= auto binPath= d:\system\ipban\ipban.exe DisplayName= IPBAN). The service writes a log file to the same directory as the service, so run as SYSTEM to ensure permissions.

Make sure to look at the config file for configuration options

To debug as a console app and troubleshoot, run "IPBAN.EXE debug"

Make sure you are logging failed login attempts via local security policy

Make sure to read this stackoverflow thread about ip addresses not getting logged: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1734635/event-logging-ipaddress-does-not-always-resolve
In summary, change these local security options:
- Network security: LAN Manager authentication level -- Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM
- Network security: Restrict NTLM: Audit Incoming NTLM Traffic -- Enable auditing for all accounts
- Network security: Restrict NTLM: Incoming NTLM traffic -- Deny all accounts

Local Computer Policy ➞ Computer Configuration ➞ Administrative Templates ➞ Windows Components ➞ Remote Desktop Services ➞ Remote Desktop Connection Client
- Do not allow for passwords to be saved -- Enabled
- Prompt for credentials on the client computer -- Enabled

If you want to run in Visual Studio, make sure to run Visual Studio as administrator

For reference, here is a regex that matches any 32 bit ip address:
(?<ipaddress>^(([0-9]|[1-9][0-9]|1[0-9]{2}|2[0-4][0-9]|25[0-5])\.){3}([0-9]|[1-9][0-9]|1[0-9]{2}|2[0-4][0-9]|25[0-5])$)
